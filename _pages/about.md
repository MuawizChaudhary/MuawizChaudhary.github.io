I am currently in the market for new opportunities, whether in an industry job or a research position. Presently, I spend my free time at the Mila-Quebec AI Institute as an alumni collaborator working with Prof. Guy Wolf. 

My interests are in exploring structures of universality in deep neural network models, aiming to obtain fundamental insight into how deep learning works and develop more accurate and robust models. My current work pushes this line by developing a principled probability distribution over pre-trained neural networks. 

I did my master's under Prof. Eugene Belilovsky at Concordia University and affiliated with Mila and the Center Hospital of the University of Montreal. There, I developed methods for enabling robustness in low-data settings under distribution shifts common in the hospital setting. Previously, I did an undergraduate at Western Washington University, a liberal arts university, where I worked on mathematically principled models of neural networks. Notably, I spent a summer as a research associate at the Flatiron Institute working on open-source research software. 

I enjoy community service, especially in the academic setting. Two highlights of my service include my time as a Mila Student Lab Representative and my mentorship of junior researchers. 

I am an avid skater. My origins as a "Cali Boy" long boarding in the sunny Bay Area contrast my love of Montreal winters that enable me to ice skate outside the lab.
